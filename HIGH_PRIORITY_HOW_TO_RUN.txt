---------------------------------------------> Part 1 <--------------------------------------

After extracting the project in AnimeAdd.java file which present in com.anime.add package,

In 72th line paste the correct path of dbImages folder in that string.

Let's see:

For me->

String uploadPath = "C:/Users/AD35995/training/DomainProject/AnimeRcmd/src/main/webapp/dbImages/"+ imageFileName;



For you -> the dbImages folder path may be different, so pls paste the correct path.

If we didn't do this... the images will not display in index.jsp.


----------------------------------------------> Part 2 <-------------------------------------------

****The admin page credintials are:

email: admin@gmail.com
password: admin123

After submitting the form------------> go to ecllipse and refresh the project and dbImages folder for image retreiving from mysql.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

You can search anime name and genre's in the search field. And the spelling should be correct.

That's all... Now we're good to go!.

Thank You.
